This is an OCR application built with AWS. It uses Rekognition APIs to detect the text in S3 Objects(image) and stores the result in DynamoDB.

For more details about how to build and deploy on AWS, and what tools are used, please refer to [my blog](https://xiaokeliu666.github.io/2020/08/09/AWS-OCR-application-based-on-Lambda/)
